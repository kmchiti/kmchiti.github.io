Ensuring the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial for their reliable deployment in uncertain scenarios, such as low-power or unsecured environments, and against adversarial attacks. Weight perturbations in quantized networks can significantly degrade performance, underscoring the need to improve DNN resilience in uncertain scenarios. This thesis presents two novel approaches to enhance DNN robustness against bit-flip errors during inference.

Here, I'd like to outline my effort here:

Hey! I’m Kamran :wave:, currently a research assistant at [Mila - Quebec AI](https://mila.quebec/en/) advised by Prof. [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/). 

My research centers on efficient ML algorithms and hardware acceleration.

Before coming to Mila, I completed my M.Sc. in EE at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) under the supervision of Prof. [Francois Leduc-Primeau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/leduc-primeau-francois), 2023. I did my B.Sc. at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://english.iut.ac.ir) in CE, 2020.
